# JUST YOU & ME — scaffold

This repository is a private, frontend-only Next.js app scaffold for the "JUST YOU & ME" project.

What I added:

- Next.js app router structure under `/app`
- Minimal components in `/components`
- Data stubs in `/data`
- Tailwind CSS + PostCSS config

Next steps (local):

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Replace the JSON files in `/data` with your final content (letters, opening lines, shayari, memories). The site is intentionally minimal and private — no analytics, no APIs.
