This is where your audio files live.

To add music or a voice note, place the file in this directory and update its path in the page component where it's used (e.g., `/app/us/page.tsx` or `/app/miss-me/page.tsx`).

For example, if you add `our-song.mp3` here, you would change the `audioSrc` in the page file to `"/audio/our-song.mp3"`.

A quiet, meaningful piece of music or a short voice note can add a lot of emotion.
